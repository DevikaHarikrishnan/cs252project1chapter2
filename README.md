# CS252 Operating Systems - Minors course - Assignment
## Individual Submission - Medium Level - Chapter 2 Project 1

### Aim of the project
The project aims to create a kernel module and load the same into the Linux kernel. Also, the kernel module is modified so that it creates an entry
in the /proc file system

### Environment Setup
I used the Linux virtual machine provided with the OS concepts text.This ensured that any errors in the code which has the potential to cause a system crash can be handled by rebooting the system. The virtual machine provided command-line based Ubuntu Server running version 4.4 of the Linux kernel. I referred source code available in the OS concepts website and referred the github link https://github.com/KhanhNguyen4999/Simple_shell_linux_c . In addition to the OS concepts book, I referred https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/making-linux-shell-c/ for more understanding
